# airmovies
The goal of Airmovies is to deploy a web application that allows users to search through airline movie entertainment catalogs, 
in which users can search by multiple parameters, inclusive with genre and airline. The idea of this project is to build it around
Elasticsearch and implement the Search UI using React or Python as I need great help on being able to build React components.
